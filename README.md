# Homehub :house:
## Description
An application I made that will help automate certain life tasks.
Currently, the application has a few features that benefit me in personal life.
This at the moment includes
* A whiteboard (this is an app that splits costs between my housemate by inputting the costs down and the application does the calculations).
* Telstra Button (allows me to go my Telstra Dashboard to pay bills)
* Optus Button (allows me to go my Optus Dashboard to pay bills)
* Todo List (simple todo list for household task such as mow lawn, inspection coming up, etc)


## Installation
Download .zip file and extract folder. On Terminal, navigate to folder directory and run 
```
npm i
```
After installation, simply run 
```
npm start
```

## Usage
Running this will simply run the **frontend** of Homehub. The backend can be found [here](https://github.com/Patoreek/Homehub-backend).
Once started, pretty self-explanitory. Only 4 Buttons on the Main menu.
Whiteboard has a simple form at the bottom of each table and todo list is a simple input.
